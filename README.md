# Better Slack Responses

A slack bot for improved automated responses in Slack using natural language processing.

## Work in progress

Not stable, early days, but feel free to join in the fun.

### Goal

1. Invite to a channel
2. Define some kind of criteria with some half-baked NLP
3. Define responses
4. Profit

### Examples

*Realism reminders*

Using words like easy or simple to describe a task is probably a gross oversimplication or you're only considering your part and effort in a task, make a bot to make you reconsider.

> Jack: _"Sure, I should be able to get that done easy"_
>
> Bot: _"Is it really that easy?"_

Counter example:

> Jack: _"I don't know if it's easy, but I'll try and work it out"_
>
> Bot:

Nothing, the bot says nothing, because the _"don't"_ and _"if"_ aren't saying it's _easy_ outright.

*Inclusive language*

Using inclusive language can make a big difference to a group's culture and avoids excluding people. Learning and retraining yourself has broader implications to fix societal imbalances in written and spoken language.

> Jack: _"Could one of you guys send me the latest report?"_
>
> Bot: _"Consider more inclusive language, next time consider using "folks", "someone", or "the team" instead"_

Counter example: Gendered language used when mentioning a person

> Jack: _"Can someone send me Jill's number, I need to give her a call"_
>
> Bot:

Or age stereotyping:

> Jack: _"Have we considered our elderly users"_
>
> Bot: _"Are you potentially stereotyping? Maybe be more specific about the needs or characteristics you're thinking about"_
